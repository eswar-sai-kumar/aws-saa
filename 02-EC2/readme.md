### IPAM

IPAM stands for IP Address Manager in AWS.

🌐 What is IPAM?
AWS IPAM helps you organize, track, assign, and manage IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) across all your AWS accounts and regions.

🔧 Why use IPAM?
Without IPAM:

You manually track IPs (e.g., in spreadsheets 😩).

You risk IP conflicts or wasted IPs.

###### With IPAM:

AWS automatically manages IPs.

Helps you allocate, monitor, and audit IP addresses.

Supports VPC creation, subnet management, and multi-account IP sharing.

IPAM → Amazon VPC IP adddress manager
